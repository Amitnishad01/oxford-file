    <p>university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly centrally.</p></div>

   <div class="amit5"> <h2>Organisation</h2>
    <p>Oxford has a distinctive collegiate structure. Students and academics benefit from belonging both to the University, a large, internationally-renowned institution, and to a college or hall, a small, interdisciplinary academic community.</p>
    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    <p>Colleges organise tutorial teaching for undergraduates. Tutorials are central to studying at Oxford, giving students an opportunity to discuss and explore their subject in small groups with an expert in the field.
        The University supervises graduate students and examines graduate theses. 
        The University determines the content of degree courses, and organises lectures, seminars and lab work for both undergraduate and graduate students. 
        The University sets and marks examinations, and awards degrees to students.</p></div>
        <h2 class="amit7">The role of the colleges and halls and the University in student life</h2>
        <p>Almost every student at Oxford is a member of a college. Most colleges admit both graduate and undergraduate students. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
